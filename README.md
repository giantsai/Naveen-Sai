## ✍️ **Medium Article – Microsoft’s Quantum Gamble**  
📌 **[Microsoft’s Majorana Bet: The Boldest Quantum Gamble Yet](https://medium.com/@covidwarrior/microsofts-majorana-bet-the-boldest-quantum-gamble-yet-da5df71308f4)**  

Ever heard of **Majorana fermions**? Microsoft thinks they hold the key to **the future of quantum computing**, and they’re going all in.  

- **The Problem:** Quantum computing has a **huge roadblock**—**current qubits (superconducting & trapped ion) are too unstable** for practical use.  
- **Microsoft’s Bet:** Instead of following **Google and IBM’s approach**, Microsoft is investing in **Majorana-based topological qubits**, which could be **far more stable and scalable**.  
- **The Reality Check:** This approach is **scientifically promising but commercially unproven**. If they succeed, Microsoft could **leapfrog the entire quantum industry**. If not? **Billions down the drain.**  

A deep dive into **quantum physics, industry strategy, and why this gamble might change computing forever.**
